# About Daankh Accessible React Components

## About

The package **Daankh Accessible React Components** helps you to implement fully-accessible React Components into your
applications and websites.

It consists of two main parts:

1. [React Hooks](hooks.md) - you can use them to create your own components. You simply use them inside the component, receive
   aria-\* props and put them to the output.
2. [React Components](Components.md) - ready-made components that use my React Hooks underneath, and return native HTML browser tags. You
   can securely use them like native
   HTML tags, because they use the common HTML interface related to them, but there are _aria-\*_ tags injected
   underneath.

The package was made according to [W3C](https://www.w3.org) standards, especially using documentations:

- [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/)
- [ARIA in HTML](https://w3c.github.io/html-aria/)
